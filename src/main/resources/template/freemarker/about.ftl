    <h1>About Collect Earth Online</h1>
    <p>Collect Earth Online is a custom built, open-source, high
    resolution satellite image viewing and interpretation system that
    is being developed by SERVIR-Mekong as a tool for use in projects
    that require land cover and/or land use reference data. Collect
    Earth Online promotes consistency in locating, interpreting, and
    labeling reference data plots for use in classifying and
    monitoring land cover / land use change. The full functionality of
    Collect Earth Online including collaborative compilation of
    reference point databases is implemented online so there is no
    need for desktop installation.</p>
