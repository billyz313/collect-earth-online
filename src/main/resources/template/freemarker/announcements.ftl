        The DigitalGlobeWMSImagery feed is experiencing a (hopefully)
        temporary blackout. In the meantime, we will be adding a
        monthly temporal imagery feed from <a href="http://planet.com">Planet</a>.
        Look for this in your institution's imagery list starting on
        May 8th.
        <!-- All institutions, users, projects, and imagery from
          <a href="http://ceo.sig-gis.com">http://ceo.sig-gis.com</a>
          have been transferred to this site. If you had a user account
          with the same email address on both websites, your password is
          the one you chose for <a href="http://collect.earth">http://collect.earth</a>.
          If you find one of your accounts or projects is missing or
          misconfigured, please notify us by submitting a ticket to our <a href="https://github.com/openforis/collect-earth-online/issues">Github Issue Tracker</a>. -->
        <!-- This site will be down for maintenance on Sunday, April 29th,
          2018 from 12:00-13:00 EDT. We will be migrating projects,
          institutions, and user accounts from ceo.sig-gis.com to this
          server. If you have a user account on both servers, your
          password will remain the same on collect.earth. Please plan
          accordingly. Thank you. -->
